    We’re currently heading north-east so if one were to fire an imaginary round it could in theory 
    carry on to Niger, or Chad, or (curving slightly) even Kenya and the sea. I’ve spent a lot of time 
    in Kenya – at Nanyuki or Archer’s Roast - and it’s so like here and so different I struggle to put
